  Tote betting involves punters choosing the outcome of a race by placing bets into a pool of money.
  Punters who successfully predict the outcome of a race take a share of the pool proportional to their stake.
  For example, a punter who places a $2 bet on a winning selection would receive twice the winnings of a punter who placed a $1 stake.
  The betting house takes a commission out of the pool before it is split between winning punters.`;
